# Portfolio README

## Overview

This README provides insights into the development process, challenges faced, lessons learned, and resources utilized during the creation of my web portfolio.

## Process

### Initial Planning

- **Mockup Creation**: I began by creating a mockup for my website, outlining the basic structure and layout.
- **Identifying Elements**: I identified the essential elements required for each page, including the home, about, contact, and portfolio pages.
- **Theme Selection**: Given my interest in space and the universe, I chose a theme centered around planets and space exploration.

### Development

- **HTML Structure**: I structured the HTML code for each page, incorporating elements such as the logo, pink overlay, title, navigation bar, and an animated astronaut image.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: I utilized Bootstrap to streamline development and ensure responsiveness across devices. Bootstrap components such as containers, flexbox, columns, and cards were instrumental in achieving a consistent layout.
- **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS was applied to enhance the visual appeal and customize certain elements to align with the chosen theme.

### Iterative Approach

- **Trial and Error**: I adopted an iterative approach, experimenting with different Bootstrap classes and observing their effects in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Maintaining consistency in layout across various screen sizes was a priority. I utilized responsive classes and components to ensure a seamless browsing experience.
